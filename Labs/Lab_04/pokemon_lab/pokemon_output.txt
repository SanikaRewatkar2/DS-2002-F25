--- Adding New Card Set ---
Enter TCG Card Set ID: base1

jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 6
C:\Users\SanikaRewatkar\Documents\College\DataScienceSystems\DS-2002-F25\Labs\Lab_04\pokemon_lab\add_card_set.sh: line 36: [: : integer expression expected
-> Cards from set with ID base1 saved successfully.

[So I just copy-pasted my base1.json abd base4.json from my last commits]
